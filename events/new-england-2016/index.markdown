The 3rd Annual TransportationCamp New England will be held on Saturday, April 9, 2016.

Following on the success of last year's event, TransportationCamp New England 2016 will continue to foster open conversation and collaboration between all parties interested in mobility and the radical changes the near-future promises in transportation.

###Goal
Our goal is to assemble planners, dreamers, programmers, students, and professionals for an exciting day of "un-conferencing." Unlike a traditional conference, the specific session topics are determined by participants, which provides each attendee an opportunity to lead and shape the event. Therefore, we want to see what you are doing; we want to ask how it will impact our lives; and we want to help you to find answers.

###Venue
The venue for TransportationCamp NE is in the process of being booked. We expect to be located on the MIT campus at the Stata Center, but will update the website upon final confirmation.

Registration for TransportationCamp NE 2016 is not yet open.
